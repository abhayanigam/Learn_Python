## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

If you are a beginner, Python is probably the way to go.

Python is easy to learn as a first language, and can be said to be 'elegant' in some views. It is very good for prototyping because it does a lot of work for you (like trash and memory management.) You also don't need to care so much about variable types because it automatically assigns them for you!

The trouble is, it's slow, so while it's good to learn and use for prototypes, you might want to pick up more languages as you go.

> Also, be aware that **capitalisation** and **whitespace** (like spaces and tabs) are VERY IMPORTANT in Python. 
>
> Whitespace errors (too many or too little before or after each line) can break your program, so make sure you set them correctly! (A single level of indentation in Python is 4 spaces.)

Here's the Python 3 style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names



## 2. Basic Python 3 Syntax Reference <a name="2"></a>

### 2.1 Comments <a name="2.1"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Comments are meant to increase readability for programmers, and will be ignored by computers!

```python
# this is a comment

''' 
multi
line comment!
'''
```



### 2.2 Importing Libraries <a name="2.2"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
import <MODULE_NAME>

# If you make your own, say... my_module.py
# This works too!

import my_module
```

Sometimes you want to extend the functionalities of your Python installation by importing modules (libraries of functions other people have written.)

Common useful modules from the standard library that comes installed with Python include:

```python
import math
import decimal
import datetime
import time
import re # Regular Expressions, check my tutorial
import sympy
import sys # For OS commands!

# When you import using import, you invoke module methods like so
math.pi
math.e

# When you import using from
from math import e

# The imported method fills the namespace and you call it without invoking the module name
print(e)
# Output: 2.718281828459045

# Handy ones are stuff like
from math import pi, e
from sympy import diff # diff(expression, variable, order of derivative)
```

More module if you want to check:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1453952/most-useful-python-modules-from-the-standard-library

https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules

```python
# If you're NOT SURE WHAT'S IN THE LIBRARY
# Do

dir(<library>)

# It'll print out all the commands in the library for you to use!
```





### 2.3 Print <a name="2.3"></a>

[go to top](#top)

You can display stuff on the console using print()

And manipulate it in cool ways!

```python
print("Hello")
# Output: Hello

print("Hello","Rar") # Comma appends with a space between each by default!
# Output: Hello Rar

print("Helloaw","Rar",sep=", ") # You can change this default though!
# Output: Hello, Rar

print("Hello\nRar") # \n is a newline character!
''' Output:
Hello
Rar
'''

print("a" * 5) # You can multiply!
# Output: aaaaa
```

If you want formatted output, use % or f

#### **Using %**

```python
# % example

Python = "AN_Python"
print("%s %s %s" % ("Hi!", "I am", Python))
# Output: Hi! I am AN_Python
# %.<decimals>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.

# With dictionaries
my_dict = {"Pythons":"Pythons", "are":"are", "the":"the", "best":"best! Yeah!"}
print("%(Pythons)s %(are)s %(the)s %(best)s" % (my_dict))
# Output: Pythons are the best! Yeah!
```


#### **Using f-strings**

```python
# f-strings (Valid from Python 3.6 onwards)

Python = "AN_Python"
stuff = "orchestral music"
print(f"Hi! I am {Python} and I make {stuff}!")
# Output: Hi! I am AN_Python and I make orchestral music!

# f-strings also support expressions! So you can do print(f{6*6})
# Output: 36
```


#### **Using .format**

```python
# .format example

Python = "AN_Python"
stuff = "orchestral music"
number = 5

print("{} makes {}!".format(Python, stuff))
# Output: AN_Python makes orchestral music

# .format has other more specific uses though!

# Custom indexing in your argument tuple!
print("{1} makes {0}!".format(Python, stuff))
# Output: orchestral music makes AN_Python!

# Formatting
print("{:.1f}".format(number))
# Output: 5.0
# Notice the number decimal places is 1!

# Expressions as arguments
print("{}".format(5*5))
# Output: 25

# Named arguments
print("{name}".format(name="AN_Python"))
# Output: AN_Python

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"Pythons":"Pythons", "are":"are", "the":"the", "best":"best! Yeah!"}
print("{Pythons} {are} {the} {best}".format(**my_dict))
# Output: Pythons are the best! Yeah!

# Format options!
# When you're using {}, you can also add :<stuff> to add extra formatting options!
# {:<10} Left padding (align left)
# {:>10} Right padding (align right)
# {:^10} Centre padding (align centre)
# {:.5} Truncate string
# {:d} Int
# {:f} Float
# {:5d} Padded Int
# {:.5f} Fixed Decimal Float
# {:08b} Binary with 8 digits zero-padded on the left

# {:+d} Sign Prefixed Number
# Eg: {42:+d} : +42 , {-42:+d} : -42
# {: d} Space Prefixed Number
# {:=5d} Control the position of the sign relative to padding!
# Eg: {42: d} : [space]42 , {-42: d} : -42

```

```python
# Also note, each print statement automatically prints a newline

print("Hi")
print("Test")

''' Output:
Hi
Test
'''

# If you want to not do that
print("Hi", end="")
print("Test")

'''
Output:
HiTest
'''

# Basically, what end="" does, is replace the newline character with whatever you put in the quotes

print("Hello", end=" I'm a Python")
# Output: Hello I'm a Python
```



### 2.4 Variables <a name="2.4"></a>

[go to top](#top)

**Variables are like containers for data**

- Variables names must start off with a letter, but can contain numbers, or underscores. (But they MUST start off with a letter.)
- They also cannot be keywords used in Python.
- Names are CASE SENSITIVE
- The Pythonic way of naming variables, is lowercase, separated by underscores. Or whatever the code was using. Keep it consistent and neat!

```python
# Assign variable values using =
my_variable = "Hi"
my_number = 6

# Imaginary numbers are possible too!!!
my_imaginary_number = 6 + 6j # Use j!

my_float = 5.3
my_string = "\"I decided I wanted to put a quote in here"
# my_string has this weird thing \" because I wanted to put a quote in!
# If printed, it reads: "I decided I wanted to put a quote in here
# This is known as an escape character
my_multiline_quote = ''' this also
works wonders
isn\'t it great?!'''

# You don't have to declare your types! Python does it for you!
# Data types are good to know though! Here's some common ones
# string: Immutable array of characters
# int: Integer
# long: Integer with more 
# float: Floating Point Number (Decimal)
# double: Float with more memory space (More decimals)
# bool: True/False
# list: Mutable ordered Array of same type
# tuple: Immutable Array of possibly different type
# dictionary: Keyed Array

# You can convert between types!
num = 1.12345
bin_num = 100
int(num) # Returns 1
int(str(bin_num), 2) # The optional base input tells int() what the input base is



# If you want to find out the type of a variable, use type()
type(my_number) # Returns <class "int">
# Note: You compare it using: type(my_number) == int
# Returns True

# If you want to find its address, use id()
id(my_number) # Returns my_number's address
```

> Ok. I said variables are like containers for data, but that only helps beginners visualise it. In Python it's a little different. The variable names you define refer to objects that store values. But when you change the value, what happens is NOT that the value stored in the referred object changes, but rather, another object is created and the variable names becomes a reference to that new object.
>
> The names are essentially rebound! (I'm guessing this might be why the performance is so meh)
>
> See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10262920/understanding-pythons-call-by-object-style-of-passing-function-arguments

```python
# Now, if you wanted to CHECK (in a conditional) what the type of a variable is
# Use isinstance!
AN_Python = "AN_Python"

if isinstance(AN_Python, str):
    print("Hello!")
elif isinstance(AN_Python, bool):
    print("oh")
```





### 2.5 Arithmetic <a name="2.5"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
+ # Add: 3 + 2 equals 5
- # Subtract: 3 - 2 equals 1
* # Multiply: 3 * 2 equals 6
/ # Divide: 3 / 2 equals 1.5

** # Exponentiate: 3 ** 2 equals 9
// # Floor Divide: 3 // 2 equals 1 (Removes any decimals)
%  # Modulo: 3 % 2 equals 1 (Modulo returns the remainder!)
```

Arithmetic priority for the basic operators in Python is as follows:

```python
0. () # Like math!
1. **
2. * / % //
3. + -

# If operators are tied, go from left to right
```

There are others though!

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/operators_precedence_example.htm



### 2.6 More Arithmetic <a name="2.6"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
# There are some shortcuts as well!

my_int = 6
my_int += 10 # Means my_int = 6 + 10, my_int now equals 16
my_int -= 10 # Means my_int = 16 - 10
'''
You get the idea. Works for the other arithmetic operators too!
%= /= //= -= += = *=
'''

# Also, you can do some arithmetic on strings!
# It's called concatenation when you're joining them
string_one = "Hi"
string_two = "ya!"

string = string_one + string_two
# string now contains: Hiya!

# Sqrt() does a square root
sqrt(4) # Returns 2
```

> NOTE: The ++ and -- operators DO NOT WORK IN PYTHON!



### 2.7 Lists <a name="2.7"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Lists store multiple values of the same datatype. They're like 'boxes in memory'.

They are also ordered! Which means you can refer to elements inside them by index! (The index starts at 0)

(They're called arrays in most other programming languages. FYI.)

Example:

```python
# Define a list with []
# AN_Python has original orcehstral music on the
music_services = ["Spotify", "YouTube", "Google Play", "iTunes", "Deezer", "And More!"]

# Index 0 is "Spotify"
# Index 1 is "YouTube"
# Index 2 is "Google Play"
# So on and so forth

# Printing from index
print(music_services[0])
# Output: Spotify

# Printing from index from the back
print(music_services[-1])
# Output: And More!

# Printing slices (Prints up to but not including the second number)
# Slice syntax: list_name[startAt:endBefore:skip]
print(music_services[0:2])
# Output: ["Spotify", "YouTube"]

# Reassinging values
music_services[5] = "Hello!"
print(music_services[5])
# Output: "Hello!"

# You can create lists of lists, by the way!

numbers_a = [1, 2, 3]
numbers_b = [4, 5, 6]
numbers_c = [7, 8, 9]

numbers_list = [numbers_a, numbers_b, numbers_c]
# numbers_list is now [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Printing from nested lists
numbers_list[0][1]
# Output: 2
# The way to read it is, from the outermost layer, read index 0 (So the first list)
# Then, within that list, read index 1
# Now practice to other elements

# Joining lists
list_one = [1, 2]
list_two = [3, 4]
list_three = list_one + list_two
# list_three now contains: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Empty list
empty_list = []
```

#### **List Comprehensions** (More on this in the advanced section)

```python
# Just some examples for reference
# [item for item in list if conditional]

x_list = [x for i in range(10)]
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


x_y_list = [(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in [3, 1, 4] if x != y]
# [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
```

> Lists are mutable types in python. That is...
>
> ```python

> b = a

> b = 0
> print(a)

### 2.8 List Methods<a name="2.8"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
Python_list = ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell"]

# Appending
Python_list.append("Rar")
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar"]
Python_list.append("Pop_Me")
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar", "Pop_Me"]

# Extending
number_list = [1, 2, 3]
extend_list = [4, 5]
# Ok. Now let's examine the differences! (Assume number_list is reinitialised between statements)
number_list.append(extend_list) # [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
number_list.extend(extend_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Notice how the list is no longer nested!

# Pop: Removes and returns the last element
Python_list.pop()
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar"]

# Inserting into an index
Python_list.insert(1, "Rrr")
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rrr", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar"]

# Removing
Python_list.remove("Rrr")
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar"]

# Delete an item
del Python_list[3]
# Python_list now contains: ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell"]

Python_list.count("Rar") # Count the number of occurances of an element in a list!
# Output: 1

Python_list.sort() # Sort!
Python_list.reverse() # Reverses order of list

# So if you want a reverse sort, do two calls. One to sort() and one to reverse()

# Return length of list
len(Python_list) # This will return 3

# Return maximum (alphanumerically)
max(Python_list) # Returns Hell

# Return minimum (alphanumerically)
min(Python_list) # Returns Hello

# Sum all values in the list
sum(Python_list) # This won't work unless the list elements are numbers though...

# Return a set containing the unique elements of the list
set([1,1,1,1,1,2]) # Returns {1, 2}

# Find index of a list element
Python_list.index("Hello")
# Output: 1
```

#### **Bonus: Treating lists as queues**

```python
import collections

# deque stands for double queue
# All list methods work with queues, but we also get some extra features!
numbers = collections.deque([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Popleft: Removes and returns the first element
numbers.popleft()
# Now: [2, 3, 4]
```



### 2.9 Tuples <a name="2.9"></a>

[go to top](#top)

So we've done lists. Now let's do Tuples!

- Tuples can contain elements of different types
- But they are immutable! You cannot reassign values once you've set them

```python
# Define a tuple using ()
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Convert a tuple into a list using list()
my_list = list(my_tuple)

# And a list back into a tuple using tuple()
my_tuple_again = tuple(my_list)

# These work the same as with list
len()
max()
min()
```
```python
# Assigning variables using tuples!
AN_tuple = ("AN","Python")

whole_tuple = AN_tuple
# whole_tuple: ("AN","Python")

AN_half, Python_half = AN_tuple
# AN_half: "AN"
# Python_half: "Python"

(AN_half, Python_half) = AN_tuple
# AN_half: "AN"
# Python_half: "Python"

# Cool Right!
```



### 2.10 Dictionaries <a name="2.10"></a>

[go to top](#top)

A dictionary is made up of values with a **UNIQUE** key for each value! It's basically a keyed list.

They're also called maps (don't be confused with map() though!)

> You can't join them like you can with lists though!

```python
# Define a dictionary using {}
species_dictionary = {"Bob" : "Human",
                     "AN_Python" : "Python",
                     "Jane" : "Snake"}
# The things to the left of the colon are the keys, and the ones on the right are the values

# To call an entry by key
species_dictionary["AN_Python"] # Returns Python

# To reassign values (Think lists, but with keys instead of indexes!)
species_dictionary["Jane"] = "Human"

# Empty dictionary
empty_dictionary = {}
```

#### **Dictionary Comprehensions** (More on this in the advanced section)

```python
# Just some examples for reference
# {key:value for item in list if conditional}

name_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

dictionary = {x : y for x, y in zip(name_list, num_list)}
# For Zip function see (2.18 Handy For Loop Functions and Keywords) section
```



### 2.11 Dictionary Methods<a name="2.11"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
# List functions work!
del dictionary_name[<key>]
len()
pop(key)
clear() # Empties the entire dictionary

# Get values
species_dictionary.get("AN_Python") # Returns Python
# This works the same as [], except, if no value is found, it defaults to None as opposed to throwing an error

# Get a list of key-value pairs
species_dictionary.items()

# Get a list of keys
species_dictionary.keys()

# Get a list of values
species_dictionary.values()

# Add a key (Update merges another dictionary!)
species_dictionary.update({"Key":"Value"})

# Add multiple keys (As above, update merges another dictionary)
species_dictionary.update({"Key_1":"Value_1", "Key_2":"Value_2"})

# Add a key (alternative) (Though it isn't an explicit method call...)
species_dictionary["Smaug"] = "Python"

# Set a default response to a particular key query if the key is not found
species_dictionary.setdefault("AN_Python", "rad_Python")
species_dictionary.setdefault("Brainless", "dumb_Python")

species_dictionary["AN_Python"] # returns "Python" (as the key was found)
species_dictionary["Brainless"] # returns "dumb_Python"
```

Example: Putting it all together!

```python
# Return a list of numbers that appear most frequently in an input list
# Show multiple if tied
# Eg. Input: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
# Output: [1, 2]

def most_frequent(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for i in lst:
        if count_dict.get(i) == None:
            count_dict.update({i : lst.count(i)})
    return [x for x in count_dict.keys() if count_dict[x] == max(count_dict.values())]
```



### 2.12 Sets <a name="2.12"></a> 

[go to top](#top)

Read more: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/set

Sets are **unordered** collections of **unique items!** Adding a duplicate to a set will not add anything!

Items added to a set must be immutable, but the set itself is mutable.

```python
# Define a set using {}
unique_numbers = {1, 1, 2, 3}
# unique_numbers : {1, 2, 3} Notice how the duplicate disappears!

# Another way is to just cast to a set
numbers = [4, 4, 5, 6]
more_unique_numbers = set(numbers)

# Empty set
# You have to do it this way since {} will initialise a dictionary!
unique_numbers = set()

# Iterate through a set using loops!
for i in unique_numbers:
    pass
```

#### **Set Comprehensions**

```python
# Just some examples for reference
# {item for item in list if conditional}

some_set = {x for x in range(10)}
```

> Remember, since sets are unordered, and the values aren't keyed, you can't index into them.



### 2.13 Set Methods <a name="2.13"></a>

[go to top](#top)

It's probably best to treat sets as completely distinct from lists and dictionaries

Set operations work ala math as well!

```python
example_set = {1, 2, 3}

# Add a value
example_set.add(3) # Nothing gets added since 3 exists already
example_set.add(4) # Now {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Add multiple values (Update merges sets!)
example_set.update([5, 6, 7]) # In this case it converts the list first

# Add multiple values (alternative)
example_set.update([5, 6, 7], {6, 7, 8}) # In case you wanted to merge a list and a set in too

# Remove a value
example_set.remove(8)

# Remove a value (alternative)
# Discard will not throw an error if the argument is not in the set
# Remove will
# It's like dictionary.get() vs dictionary[index]!
example_set.discard(8)

# Remove the last value
example_set.pop() # This will also return the value

# Clear the set
example_set.clear()

# There's a bunch more: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/set
```

#### **Set Operations**

```python
a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {"Hello", "Hell", 3}

# Union
print(a | b) # {1, 2, 3, 'Hell', 'Hello'}

# Intersection
print(a & b) # {3}

# Difference (A - B)
print(a - b) # {1, 2}
print(b - q) # {'Hell', 'Hello'}

# Symmetric difference (Opposite of intersection)
print(a ^ b) # {1, 2, 'Hell', 'Hello'}
```



### 2.14 Conditionals <a name="2.14"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Read more: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators

```python
== # equal to 
!= # NOT equal to
> # more than
< # less than
>= #  more than or equal to
<= # less than or equal to

is # Checks if something is the same object as something else
# Eg.
# 1 == True (Returns True)
# 1 is True (Returns False, as 1 does not refer to the same object)
```

> NOTE. "==" IS **NOT** "="
>
> == COMPARES
>
> = ASSIGNS VALUES

#### **Logical Operators**

```python
and # Eg: (a and b) is True
or # Eg: (a or b) is True
not # Eg: not(a and b) is False
```

#### **Example IF, ELIF, ELSE**

```python
Python_rating = 10

if Python_rating < 10 : # If condition is fulfilled
    print("NEEDS MORE PythonS") # Do this
elif Python_rating < 15 : # Else, If condition is fulfilled
    print("Good, but needs MORE") # Do this instead
else : # Else
    print("EXCELLENT") # Do this otherwise
```

```python
# ONE MORE! Let's do it with logical operators now

is_Python = True
Python_rating = 10

if (Python_rating < 10 and is_Python == True) :
    print("Oh no! Pythons shouldn't hate themselves!")
elif (Python_rating < 10 and is_Python != True) :
    print("NEEDS MORE PythonS")
else :
    print("Well ok then. Hell.")
```

**in**

```python
# The in keyword is a nice way to call an object's __contains__ method

# It works as such
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2 in num_list # Returns True
6 in num_list # Returns False

# Basically it's used to check if something is in an iterable (more on iterables later)!
```

**any() and all()**

```python
# Think of any() and all() as a series of 'or' and 'and' operators

# any() returns True if at least one element is True
# all() returns True if all elements are True

# Example
any([True, False, False]) # Returns True
all([True, False, False]) # Returns False
all([True, True, True]) # Returns True

# Use it with a list comprehension!
def is_prime(n):
    return n > 1 and all(n % i for i in range(2,n))

# Specifically, they are functions that take in ITERABLES
# Iterables are anything that can be iterated over (strings, lists, tuples)
# Example:
any((1 == 2, 2 == 3, True)) # Returns True 
all((1 == 2, 2 == 3, True)) # Returns False
```
```python
# BONUS: Combine any and all with in!
all(x in num_list for x in range(5)) # Returns False : x is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
all(x in num_list for x in range(1, 5)) # Returns True : x is 1, 2, 3, 4
```



### 2.15 Ternary Operators <a name="2.15"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Use these if you want to look cool!

Example

```c++
// a if condition else b

print("True") if 5 == 5 else print("False")
```

> I prefer C's way though... 
>
> (condition) ? true : false;

### 2.16 User Input <a name="2.16"></a>

[go to top](#top)

```python
# Use input() !!
input_variable = input("Input here: ") # The console will display Input Here: 

# You can also convert the input to whatever you need!
float_input = float(input("Put your float here: "))
```

```python
# Example Input Validation
while not userID or not password or " " in userID or " " in password:

    userID = "1"
    password = "1"

    userID = str(input("Key In Your Username!:"))
    password = str(input("Key In Your Password!:"))

    if not userID or not password or " " in userID or " " in password:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter again!\n")
    else:
        print()
```



> NOTE: DO NOT USE eval() UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
>
> It lets the user run code directly in your program. That's what eval() does-- run whatever was eval()'ed as if it were code!



### 2.17 For Loops <a name="2.17"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Python does for loops in a way I don't really prefer... (I learnt them doing C) But eh, I guess it can be a little more intuitive...?

If you really want to go advanced and ask about how the for loop really works, see:

https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/for-loop

```python
# Iterate FOR each element in a list
# Output: Hello Rar Hell Rar
my_list = ["Hello", "Rar", "Hell", "Rar"]
for roar in my_list:
    print(roar, end=" ")

# Iterate FOR some range of numbers
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
for element in range(10): # You can call the element anything, some people even use _ !!
    print(element, end=" ")
    
# You can use the iterations to do stuff with them!
# Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
count = 0
for _ in range(10):
    count += 1
    print(count, end=", ")
```



### 2.18 Handy For Loop Functions and Keywords <a name="2.18"></a>

[go to top](#top)

#### **range()**

```python
# range(start, non-inclusive end, steps)
range(5) # Returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
range(3,6) # Returns [3, 4, 5]
range(4,10,2) # Returns [4, 6, 8]
range(0,-10,-2) # Returns [0, -2, -4, -8]

# If you want to turn a list's elements into a list of indexes
list_name = ["Hello", "Hell", "Rar"]
range(len(list_name)) # Returns [0, 1, 2]
```

#### **Slicing**

```python
# Remember that you can slice lists!
# list_name[startAt:endBefore:skip]
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for _ in my_list[::2]
    print(_,end=" ")
    
# Output: 1 3 5 7 9
```

#### **enumerate()**

```python
Hello_list = ["Hello", "Rar", "Rar", "Hell"]

# Enumerate() returns a list of tuples, with an increasing counter
# Output: 0 Hello, 1 Rar, 2 Rar, 3 Hell,
for num, Hello in enumerate(Hello_list):
    print(num, Hello, end=", ")

# You can also tweak the starting number!
# Output: 5 Hello, 6 Rar, 7 Rar, 8 Hell,
for num, Hello in enumerate(Hello_list, 5):
    print(num, Hello, end=", ")
```

#### **zip()**

```python
Hello_list = ["Hello", "Rar", "Rar", "Hell"]
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Zip() lets you iterate through multiple lists!
# Output: Hello 1, Rar 2, Rar 3, Hell 4,
for x, y in zip(Hello_list, num_list):
    print(x, y, end=", ")
```

#### **continue and break**

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Continue skips the rest of the execution for the current loop, but continues the loop
# Output: 1 Check! 2 3 Check! 4 Check! 5 Check!
for x in num_list:
    print(x, end=" ")
    if x == 2:
        continue
    print("Check!", end=" ")
    
# Break just ends the entire loop then and there
# Output: 1 Check! 2
for x in num_list:
    print(x, end=" ")
    if x == 2:
        break
    print("Check!", end=" ")
```



### 2.19 While loops <a name="2.19"></a> 

[go to top](#top)

Use these when you don't know ahead of time when this loop is going to end. Note! The condition is checked right BEFORE each run through of the loop, NOT THROUGHOUT!

```python
import random

random_num = random.randrange(0, 100) # Generate a random number between 0 and 100

while(random_num != 15): # This while loop will stop once random_num becomes 15
    print(random_num)
    random_num = random.randrange(0, 100)
```

It'll print until the condition is no longer fulfilled! So in this case we'll print random numbers until random_num assumes the value 15.

Here's another example!

```python
i = 0

while(i <= 20): # This while loop will stop once i becomes 21
    print(i)
```

>  You can also use all the cool stuff listed in the previous section with while loops!
>
>  Even break and continue!

```python
# I didn't want to write a new section for a do-while loop
# since Python doesn't explicitly support it
# But... Here's an example implementation. It's good for state machines!

do_check = True
while do_check or <condition>:
    do_check = False # This won't break the loop until condition is checked again!
    do_stuff()
```





### 2.20 Strings <a name="2.20"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Let's play around with strings!

```python
Hello_string = "I am AN_Python, and while I can talk, I also Smile!"

# Slice strings!
Hello_string[0:4] # Returns first 4 characters! "I am"
Hello_string[-5:] # Returns last 5 characters! "Smile!"
Hello_string[:-5] # Returns everything UNTIL the last 5 characters!

# Join strings
Hello_string[:-5] + "Smile!"
# Output: I am metyhlPython, and while I can talk, I also Smile!
```

#### **Formatted Strings** (repeated from print)

```python
# % example

Python = "AN_Python"
print("%s %s %s" % ("Hi!", "I am", Python))
# Output: Hi! I am AN_Python

# f example (Valid from Python 3.6 onwards)

Python = "AN_Python"
stuff = "orchestral music"
print(f"Hi! I am {Python} and I make {stuff}!")
# Output: Hi! I am AN_Python and I make orchestral music!

# .format example

Python = "AN_Python"
stuff = "orchestral music"
print('{} makes {}!'.format(Python, stuff))
# Output: AN_Python makes orchestral music

# Extra options
# There are a lot more! https://pyformat.info/
# When you're using {}, you can also add :<stuff> to add extra formatting options!
# {:<10} Left padding (align left)
# {:>10} Right padding (align right)
# {:^10} Centre padding (align centre)
# {:.5} Truncate string
# {:d} Int
# {:f} Float
# {:5d} Padded Int

```



### 2.21 String Functions <a name="2.21"></a>

[go to top](#top)

> **NOTE**: ALL THESE METHODS DO NOT CHANGE THE STRING. It's not like list append or extend!
>
> If you want to change the string, reassign it!

```python
Hello_string = "I am AN_Python, and while I can talk, I also Smile!"

# Capitalise the first letter of the string
Hello_string.capitalize()

# Return the index of a found string (Case-Sensitive)
Hello_string.find("Smile") # Returns 48

# Check to see if everything is alphabetical
Hello_string.isalpha() # Returns False (we have punctuation!)

# Check to see if everything is alphanumeric
Hello_string.isalnum() # Returns False (because, of course, we have punctuations!)

# Check to see if everything is numeric
Hello_string.isdigit() # Returns False

# Find length
len(Hello_string)

# Replace
Hello_string.replace("AN_Python", "a Python")
# Let's undo that
Hello_string.replace("a Python", "AN_Python")

# Strip away all trailing whitespaces
Hello_string.strip()

Hello_string = "I am AN_Python, and while I can talk, I also Smile!" # Let's reset

# Split a string by some delimiter
# Note, this does not change the string! You must reassign this!
Hello_string.split(",")
# Output: ['I am AN_Python', 'and while I can talk', ' I also Smile!']

# split() if left without any arguments splits by a varying length of whitespace!
space_string = "hello    \nthis is    great"
space_string.split() # Returns ['hello', 'this', 'is', 'great']

# Using strings to join lists of strings!
# Remember to save!
"|".join(["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]) # Returns '1|2|3|4|5'

# Pad with zeroes from the left
"a".zfill(5) # "0000a" (4 zeroes)
```



### 2.22 Exception Handling and Debugging <a name="2.22"></a>

[go to top](#top)

By far the most important concept for debugging purposes! Try to always use them!

Alternatively, if you know where a program might throw **exceptions** (i.e. errors), you can code in handlers for them if you know they can occur but it's either by design or because it might be user errors, etc. !

#### **Try-Except**

```python
# Exception handling is done mostly with try-except blocks
try:
    # Some code
except <error_one>:
    # Run this code ONLY if an exception for <error_one> is thrown
except <error_two> as err:
    print(err) # Print the error ONLY if <error_two> is thrown
except:
    # Wildcard error. Run this code ONLY if an exception unaccounted for is thrown
```


#### **Else**

```python
# You can also use else in try-except blocks!
try:
    # Some code
except:
    # Wildcard error handler
else:
    # Run if no errors were thrown AFTER running the code protected by the try block
```


#### **Finally**

```python
# You use the keyword finally to run code regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not
try:
    # Some code
except:
    # Wildcard error handler
else:
    # Run if NO ERRORS were thrown
finally:
    # Run before exiting the entire try block, whether errors were thrown or not
```

#### **Raise**

```python
# You can raise an exception, forcing it occur
raise NameError('some_string')

# Let's say you do this in the try block
# The first raise won't be thrown, so you can Raraise it using just raise
try:
    raise NameError('some_string')
except:
    raise
```

#### **Assert**

This of an assert like a raise-if-not statement
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp#:~:text=The%20assert%20keyword%20lets%20you,False%2C%20check%20the%20example%20below.

```python
# Raise an exception if the condition returns False
assert (5 == 5), "5 is not equal to 5!" # This will just run properly
assert (5 != 5), "5 is equal to 5!" # This will raise an error!

# Specifically,
# AssertionError: 5 is equal to 5!

# Assertions are a good way to make your own checks, and raise your own exceptions
```

#### **With**

```python
# This isn't exactly exception handling, and I mention it again in file I/O
# But... This is still useful

with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    # Some code
    
# Because the file was opened, an object was created
# With ensures that the file will be closed and cleaned from memory when appropriate
```



### 2.23 Iterations, Iterables, Iterators, and More! <a name="2.23"></a>

[go to top](#top)

We know more or less what Iterations are, since we went through the for and while loops.

An **iteration** is the process of going through a list, array, or set of elements **one at a time**.

Ever wondered how this works? Python implements this using Iterables and Iterators!

- **Iterables** are objects that can be iterated on
  
- Things that can be used in a for loop! List comprehensions, lists, strings, all that good stuff!
  
- There is a special kind of iterator called a **Generator**
  
  - ```python
    # Unlike lists, you can't do a for loop over this more than once
    my_generator = (x * x for x in range(3))
    
    # Generators can only be iterated over ONCE. 
    # They do not store values in memory, but instead generate them on the fly
    ```
  
- **Iterators** are objects that define how the iteration is done! (Specifically, what the next item to be iterated is.)

  -  Think of them as text 'cursors' that point to objects in an iterable

  - Iterators are iterables in their own right! It has an \_\_iter\_\_ and \_\_next\_\_ methods, which allow it to perform its function!

  - Example execution

    ```python
    >>> Hello = "Hello" # iterable
    >>> b1 = iter(Hello) # iterator 1
    >>> b2 = iter(Hello) # iterator 2, independent of b1
    >>> next(b1)
    'r'
    >>> next(b1)
    'a'
    >>> next(b2) # start over, as it is the first call to b2. Independent iterator!
    'r'
    >>> next(b1)
    'w'
    >>> next(b1)
    'r'
    >>> next(b1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    StopIteration
    >>> b1 = iter(a) # new one, start over
    >>> next(b1)
    'r'
    ```

#### **Intuition**

> I don’t know if it helps anybody but I always like to visualize concepts in my head to better understand them. So as I have a little son I visualize iterable/iterator concept with bricks and white paper.
>
> Suppose we are in the dark room and on the floor we have bricks for my son. Bricks of different size, color, does not matter now. Suppose we have 5 bricks like those. Those 5 bricks can be described as an **object** – let’s say a **bricks kit**. We can do many things with this bricks kit – can take one and then take second and then third, can change places of bricks, put first brick above the second. We can do many sorts of things with those. Therefore this bricks kit is an **iterable object** or **sequence** as we can go through each brick and do something with it. We can only do it like my little son – we can play with **one** brick **at a time**. So again I imagine myself this bricks kit to be an **iterable**.
>
> Now remember that we are in the dark room. Or almost dark. The thing is that we don’t clearly see those bricks, what color they are, what shape etc. So even if we want to do something with them – aka **iterate through them** – we don’t really know what and how because it is too dark.
>
> What we can do is near to first brick – as element of a bricks kit – we can put a piece of white fluorescent paper in order for us to see where the first brick-element is. And each time we take a brick from a kit, we replace the white piece of paper to a next brick in order to be able to see that in the dark room. This white piece of paper is nothing more than an **iterator**. It is an **object as well**. But an object that we can use to work and play with elements of our iterable object – the bricks kit.
